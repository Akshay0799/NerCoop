Many	O

Yes	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
because	O

It	O
is	O

a	O

that	O

Well	O
,	O
sometimes	O
under	O

,	O
sometimes	O
,	O
we	O
often	O
feel	O
that	O
it	O

for	O

with	O
one	O

For	O

revelations	O

first	B-ORDINAL
,	O
I	O
think	O
one	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
especially	O
important	O
is	O
early	O
warnings	O
and	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
currently	O

there	O
are	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
frequently	O
various	O

in	O

ah	O

Early	O

Yes	O

this	O
kind	O
of	O
early	O

forecast	O
mechanism	O

Uh-huh	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
only	O
for	O

this	O
kind	O

ah	O

in	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O

Uh-huh	O

In	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
manage	O

Another	O
thing	O
I	O

that	O

speedy	O

I	O

some	O

In	O
fact	O

that	O

a	O

For	O

we	O
have	O
an	O

is	O
to	O

,	O
we	O
have	O
many	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
question	O
is	O
how	O

handles	O
these	O
various	O

an	O

,	O
well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O

be	O
made	O
to	O
the	O
formation	O
of	O
a	O

I	O
think	O

in	O

He	O
said	O
exactly	O
what	O
the	O
Russian	B-NORP
wanted	O
to	O
hear	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
dispute	O
over	O
Washington	B-GPE
between	O
Holland	B-GPE

Germany	B-GPE
should	O

that	O

be	O
no	O

as	O
he	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
this	O

Now	O
this	O
is	O
something	O
the	O
Indians	O
have	O
been	O
saying	O
all	O
along	O

Of	O

,	O
Washington	B-GPE
wants	O
international	O
attention	O

on	O
Holland	B-GPE

and	O
Mr.	O
Jack	B-PERSON
also	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
supports	O
Germany	B-GPE
's	O
tough	O
approach	O
to	O
the	O
external	O
violence	O
in	O
Britain	B-GPE
as	O
he	O
described	O
it	O

This	O
is	O
another	O
thing	O
that	O
the	O
Hollandn	B-NORP
were	O
glad	O
to	O
hear	O
him	O
say	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
also	O
said	O
that	O
both	O
Washington	B-GPE

Britain	B-GPE
suffer	O
from	O
the	O
same	O
sort	O
of	O

as	O
he	O

So	O
on	O

I	O
do	O

I	O
might	O
even	O
add	O
pleased	O

Leo	B-PERSON

I	O
think	O
the	O
real	O
next	O
step	O
here	O
is	O
for	O

they	O
're	O

I	O
have	O
n't	O

it	O

then	O
I	O
saw	O
in	O

I	O

I	O

before	O
%uh	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
company	O
now	O
that	O
I	O

working	O
with	O
%um	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
very	O

just	O
myself	O

Lu	B-PERSON

oh	O

And	O
that	O
%um	O

No	O
,	O
you	O
had	O
n't	O

%eh	O
,	O
oh	O
,	O
okay	O
.	O

okay	O
,	O
so	O
%um	O

%eh	O
you	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
you	O
were	O
leaving	O
the	O
company	O
that	O
you	O
were	O
at	O
,	O

and	O
you	O
were	O
entertaining	O
offers	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
%uh	O

well	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
make	O
sense	O
since	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
client	O
to	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
set	O
up	O
my	O
own	O
company	O
,	O
of	O
sorts	O
.	O

%um	O
oh	O
.	O
So	O
things	O
are	O
going	O
extremely	O
well	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
one	O
client	O
who	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
'd	O
pay	O
me	O
a	O

.	O

You	O
know	O
,	O
he	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O

there	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
minimum	O
amount	O
of	O
work	O
,	O
of	O
about	O
%uh	O
,	O
a	O
day	O
a	O

for	O
August	B-DATE
1998	I-DATE
.	O
mhm	O
.	O
Which	O
is	O
sufficient	O
to	O
pay	O
all	O
my	O
bills	O
then	O

so	O
I	O
decided	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
make	O
sense	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
.	O

%um	O
and	O
,	O
%um	O
,	O
I	O
've	O
been	O
getting	O
substantially	O
more	O
work	O
than	O
then	O
.	O

%mm	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
'm	O
quite	O
pleased	O
.	O

Well	O
that	O
's	O
good	O
.	O

%um	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
%uh	O
work	O
that	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
do	O
on	O
my	O
flat	O
the	B-DATE
14	I-DATE

I	O
've	O

that	O

for	O
quite	O
some	O
time	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
come	O
out	O

oh	O
,	O
well	O
that	O
's	O

in	O
six	B-DATE

oh	O
,	O
yeah	O

I	O

it	O
at	O
one	O

yeah	O
,	O

yeah	O

So	O
you	O
have	O
no	O

any	O

You	O
see	O
the	O
one	O
very	O
annoying	O
thing	O
about	O
all	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
was	O
my	O

in	O
Tanshui	B-GPE
for	O
six	B-DATE
years	I-DATE
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

And	O
this	O
made	O
writing	O
my	O
thesis	O
very	O
annoying	O
because	O
you	O
know	O
there	O
was	O
n't	O
much	O
discussion	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

yup	O
,	O

yup	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
%um	O
Anyway	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
kind	O
of	O
telling	O
him	O
that	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
from	O
my	O
reading	O
of	O
the	O
literature	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
this	O
2200	B-CARDINAL
little	O
alteration	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
in	O
my	O
model	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
clever	O
and	O
unique	O
.	O

mhm	O
.	O

And	O
it	O
made	O
the	O
14.5	B-CARDINAL
type	O
of	O
solution	O
occur	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
seen	O
experimentally	O
,	O

but	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
models	O
%uh	O
,	O
had	O
?	O

Yes	O
.	O

the-	O
,	O

I	O
'm	O
looking	O
at	O
,	O
%um	O
,	O
multi	O
mode	O
lasers	O
.	O

And	O
2450	B-CARDINAL
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
they	O
find	O
experimentally	O
are	O
what	O
they	O
call	O
anti	O
phased	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
states	O
,	O
where	O
if	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
total	O
intensity	O
uh-huh	O
.	O
of	O
the	O
laser	O
,	O
you	O
get	O
an	O
oscillation	O
which	O
is	O
characterized	O
by	O
one	O
frequency	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

okay	O
.	O

if	O
you	O
separate	O
out	O
the	O
different	O
modes	O
of	O
the	O
laser	O
mhm	O
.	O
and	O
look	O
at	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
,	O
you	O
get	O
thirty	B-CARDINAL
thousand	I-CARDINAL
frequency	O
.	O

okay	O
.	O

So	O
what	O
's	O
happening	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
modes	O
are	O
oscillating	O
out	O
of	O
phase	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
completely	O
mask	O
each	O
other	O
's	O
Exactly	O
.	O
%hm	O
.	O
oscillations	O
on	O
these	O
other	O
frequencies	O
.	O

And	O
%uh	O
With	O
a	O
pretty	O
simple	O
model	O
you	O
can	O
find	O
that	O
frequency	O
in	O
a	O
transient	O
,	O

but	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
find	O
that	O
frequency	O
in	O
a	O
driven	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
frequency	O
.	O

You	O
ca	O
n't	O
find	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
will	O
sustain	O
.	O

okay	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

So	O
yeah	O
,	O
that	O
particular	O
frequency	O
according	O
to	O
most	O
models	O
damps	O
out	O
very	O
quickly	O
.	O

And	O
so	O
you	O
should	O
n't	O
actually	O
really	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
ever	O
see	O
it	O
.	O

%hm	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
you	O
do	O
the	O
experiment	O
you	O
see	O
it	O
.	O

Got	O
it	O
,	O

got	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
see	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
%um	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
simple	O
modification	O
of	O
the	O
original	O
formula	O
,	O
which	O
unfortunately	O
makes	O
the	O
solutions	O
horrendously	O
nasty	O
.	O
And	O
in	O
most	O
cases	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
insoluble	O
.	O

But	O
yeah	O
.	O
it	O
gives	O
a	O
driving	O
term	O
.	O

oh	O
,	O
okay	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
it	O
actually	O
creates	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
you	O
get	O
the	O
right	O
sort	O
of	O
answer	O
,	O
you	O
just	O
ca	O
n't	O
always	O
write	O
it	O
down	O
very	O
easily	O
.	O

Exactly	O
.	O

oh	O
wow	O
.	O

so	O
you	O
're	O
pushing	O
forward	O
the	O
bounds	O
of	O
theoretical	O
laser	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
whatever	O
it	O
is	O
science	O
.	O

But	O

which	O
,	O
%um	O
,	O
is	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O
considering	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
really	O
my	O

Indeed	O

%um	O
Indeed	O

oh	O
wow	O

oh	O
,	O
impressive	O

But	O

so	O
are	O
you	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
an	O

VOA	B-ORG
or	O
something	O
?	O

%um	O
,	O
actually	O
,	O
I	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
we	O
're	O

for	O
op-	O
,	O

I	O
think	O
The	B-ORG

probably	O
the	O

that	O
we	O

else	O
,	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
quite	O

would	O
be	O
BBC	B-ORG

.	O

%hm	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
write	O
a	O
letter	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
seven	B-CARDINAL
six	I-CARDINAL
articles	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

%hm	O
.	O
impressive	O

And	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
much	O
you	O
know	O
about	O
scientific	O

but	O
letters	O
are	O
much	O
more	O

than	O
,	O
articles	O

oh	O
,	O
okay	O
.	O

oh	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
realize	O
that	O
.	O

okay	O

yeah	O
,	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
why	O
it	O
's	O
actually	O
a	O
big	O
deal	O
is	O

I	O
mean	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
writing	O
a	O

and	O
yeah	O
.	O
%uh	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
be	O

that	O
is	O
the	O

all	O

And	O
what	O
's	O
actually	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O
is	O
I	O
kept	O
telling	O
Lu	B-PERSON
that	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
significant	O
.	O

And	O
Lu	B-PERSON
kept	O
writing	O

that	O
I	O
should	O
tone	O
this	O

it	O
's	O
true	O

they	O
do	O
in	O
the	O
transients	O

And	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
trouble	O
getting	O
across	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
all	O
of	O
the	O

has	O
this	O
frequency	O
in	O
the	O

Yes	O
.	O
%eh	O
and	O
not	O
driven	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
what	O
happened	O
was	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
turned	O
in	O
my	O
thesis	O
but	O
before	O
I	O
saw	O
Tu	B-PERSON
again	O
,	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
conference	O
in	O
Tanshui	B-GPE
and	O
there	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
big	O
issue	O
among	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
were	O
doing	O
this	O
work	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
their	O

could	O
n't	O
show	O
this	O
as	O
a	O

yet	O
their	O

showed	O
it	O
as	O
a	O

frequency	O
.	O

oh	O
cool	O
.	O

and	O
so	O
Tu	B-PERSON
then	O
--	O
Said	O
oh	O
just	O
a	O
evening	B-TIME
I	O
--	O
like	O
these	B-DATE
weeks	I-DATE
came	O
to	O
The	B-ORG
World	I-ORG

and	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
hey	O
Tanshui	B-PERSON
,	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
write	O
this	O
up	O
.	O

Exactly	O
.	O

And	O
I	O
was	O
like	O
,	O
well	O
I	O
've	O
been	O
telling	O
you	O
that	O
Lin	B-PERSON
.	O

Indeed	O
.	O

So	O
Cool	O
.	O
Cool	O
.	O
that	O
's	O
mostly	O
the	O
sort	O
of	O
stuff	O
that	O
I	O
'm	O
spending	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
on	O
now	O
.	O
%um	O

Well	O
it	O
'll	O
look	O
good	O
on	O
your	O
C	O
V	O
,	O
your	O
resume	O

so	O
you	O
might	O
as	O
well	O
spend	O
the	O
time	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
well	O
,	O

%uh	O
,	O
no	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
definitely	O
worth	O
doing	O
.	O
%um	O
,	O

and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
spending	O
more	O
time	O
on	O
it	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
n't	O
for	O
%uh	O
dealing	O
with	O
the	O
burglary	O
issues	O
oh	O
yeah	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
've	O
been	O
dealing	O
with	O
.	O

So	O
are	O
you	O
still	O
living	O
in	O
that	O
house	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
park	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

yeah	O
,	O
okay	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

I	O
mean	O
the	O
thing	O
that	O
i-	O

this	O
place	O
is	O
incredibly	O
easy	O
to	O
break	O
into	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
.	O

oh	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
question	O
of	O
whether	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
%uh	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
easy	O
,	O

it	O
was	O
just	O
that	O
no	O
one	O
really	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
breaking	O
into	O
.	O

Exactly	O
.	O

Exactly	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

And	O
so	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
now	O
they	O
found	O
out	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
worth	O
breaking	O
into	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

And	O
unfortunately	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
odd	O
.	O

They	O
've	O
stolen	O
very	O
weird	O
things	O
for	O
the	O
most	O
part	O
.	O

%hm	O
.	O

as	O
far	O

yeah	O

as	O
a	O
.	O

The	O
first	B-ORDINAL
time	O
they	O
broke	O
in	O
,	O
what	O
they	O
stole	O
was	O
just	O
bizarre	O
,	O

mostly	O
worthless	O
stuff	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
%uh	O
%huh	O
the	O
most	O
worthwhile	O
thing	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
monetary	O
value	O
went	O
that	O
they	O
stole	O
was	O
the	O
pre-amplifier	O
of	O
my	O
stereo	O
.	O
Unfortunately	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
nice	O
pre-amplifier	O
,	O

it	O
has	O
an	O
off	O
board	O
power	O
supply	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O
steal	O
,	O
which	O
makes	O
the	O
thing	O
that	O
they	O
**stoled**	O
absolutely	O
worthless	O
.	O

%huh	O
.	O

So	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
bizarre	O
.	O
Bizarre	O
.	O

so	O
when	O
they	O
broke	O
in	O
the	O
first	B-ORDINAL
time	O
did	O
they	O
steal	O
the	O
%uh	O
offboard	O
amplifier	O
?	O

Actually	O
,	O
no	O
,	O

all	O
they	O
stole	O
the	O
first	B-ORDINAL
time	O
was	O
my	O
bike	O
.	O

%huh	O
.	O

Which	O
was	O
actually	O
where	O
the	O
major	O
problem	O
came	O
.	O
Exactly	O
.	O
Exactly	O
.	O
yeah	O
.	O
Is	O
that	O
I	O
suddenly	O
had	O
no	O
transportation	O
.	O

And	O
so	O
,	O
I	O
then	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
bike	O
hunting	O
and	O
eventually	O
get	O
another	O
bike	O
,	O

and	O
%mm	O
.	O
that	O
cost	O
me	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

Exactly	O
.	O

Because	O
,	O

yes	O

Spending	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
hunting	O
for	O
bikes	O
,	O
and	O
nah	O
well	O
.	O
then	O
getting	O
700	B-CARDINAL
purchased	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
having	O
to	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
go	O
get	O
it	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
that	O
's	O
dealt	O
with	O
at	O
least	O
.	O

And	O
so	O
%uh	O
,	O
that	O
's	O
yeah	O
at	O
least	O
dealt	O
with	O
.	O

Now	O
I	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
work	O
on	O
the	O
financial	O
aspects	O
of	O
all	O
of	O
this	O
.	O

But	O
yeah	O
.	O
yeah	O
.	O

At	O
least	O
Well	O
that	O
would	O
make	O
sense	O
during	O
the	B-DATE
26th	I-DATE
%uh	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
stipulations	O
of	O
my	O
fellowship	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
actually	O
earn	O
money	O
during	O
the	O
summer	O
.	O

But	O
%uh	O
,	O
yeah	O
,	O

it	O
's	O
still	O
a	O
fairly	O
expensive	O
call	O

%uh	O
but	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
less	O
expensive	O
if	O
we	O
do	O
it	O
that	O
way	O
than	O
if	O
we	O
actually	O
make	O
my	O
parents	O
in	O
law	O
pay	O
it	O
,	O

then	O
it	O

the	O
Palestinian	B-NORP
have	O
such	O
high	O
taxes	O
on	O
those	O

they	O
consider	O
it	O
a	O
luxury	O
to	O
call	O
around	O
the	O
world	O

so	O
they	O
tax	O
it	O
really	O
high	O
.	O

Anyway	O
%um	O

So	O
you	O
guys	O
will	O
be	O
in	O
either	O
the	B-DATE
minutes	I-DATE
or	O
December	B-DATE
12	I-DATE

and	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
%uh	O
Tanshui	B-GPE
.	O

Well	O
I	O
would	O
say	O
is	O
once	O
you	O
're	O
at	O
a	O
hotel	O
uh-huh	O
%um	O
,	O
why	O
do	O
n't	O
you	O
call	O
me	O
at	O
work	O
and	O
let	O
me	O
know	O
where	O
you	O
are	O
,	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
can	O
make	O
arrangements	O
that	O
day	O
%um	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
meet	O
you	O
in	O
Tanshui	B-GPE
.	O

And	O
maybe	O
I	O
'll	O
come	O
by	O
,	O
public	O
transport	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
probably	O
easier	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
come	O
by	O
public	O
transport	O
in	O
Tanshui	B-GPE
than	O
it	O
is	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
come	O
by	O
car	O
to	O
be	O
honest	O
.	O

mhm	O
.	O

The	O
streets	O
are	O
small	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
parking	O

So	O
I	O
probably	O
will	O
come	O
by	O
public	O
transport	O

but	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

We	O
'll	O
see	O
where	O
you	O
're	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
a	O

if	O
you	O

Somehow	O
I	O
had	O
this	O
feeling	O
that	O
the	O

had	O
been	O

What	O
we	O
know	O
about	O
Lanny	B-PERSON
Davis	I-PERSON
in	O
that	B-DATE
Friday	I-DATE
is	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
changed	O
a	O

He	O
had	O
Kurds	B-NORP
tendecies	O
and	O
acts	O
which	O
many	O
Marines	B-NORP
mentioned	O

that	O

many	O

But	O
some	O
explained	O
his	O
Putin	B-PERSON
tendency	O
by	O
saying	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
currying	O

as	O
if	O

I	O
have	O
followed	O
Lanny	B-PERSON
Davis	I-PERSON
,	O
especially	O
in	O
just	B-DATE
before	I-DATE
,	O
and	O
I	O
noticed	O
about	O
him	O
was	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
religion	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
injustice	O
and	O
coarseness	O
.	O

And	O
his	O
punishment	O
was	O
unjust	O
.	O

I	O
mean	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
the	O
dancer	O
would	O
be	O
killed	O
after	O
first	B-ORDINAL
offence	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
expect	O
anyone	O
to	O
kill	O
the	O
dancer	O
unless	O
good	O
would	O
come	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
like	O
the	O
most	O

his	O
aim	O
was	O
correct	O

the	O

Another	O

after	O
his	O

he	O
was	O

that	O
