**Task 1: Understanding NER**
(2 weeks? - May 2022)

- Learn to use a few existing NLP libraries   
    1. with off the shelf models (e.g., spacy, flair, stanza, huggingface)  
2. libraries that support fine-tuning language models for NER (tner -https://github.com/asahi417/tner)  
- identify some problem areas (e.g., sensitivity to certain kinds of inputs, not doing well for some NE tags compared to others etc)  

**Task 3: Multilingual NER**
Training some models and comparing 
goal: to familiarize with the training, tuning, comparisons process
can use multiconer dataset or anyother.

**Task 2: Understanding Weak Supervision and Domain Adaptation** 
(2 weeks? -May 2022)
- weak supervision (skweak, knodle, flying squid)
- domain adaptation, few short learning
- prompt based learning
