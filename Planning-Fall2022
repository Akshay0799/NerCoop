until 31st August: WIESP Shared task, report writing etc.  

Sep: Wrapping up adversarial testing, may be do adversarial fine-tuning experiments, writing up and submitting the paper to ACL Rolling Review.  

End of Sep, 1st week of Oct: Reading on cross-lingual transfer.  

Oct-Nov: explore cross-lingual transfer approaches for NER.  
(few shot or zero shot. Goal: how can we reuse NER model trained on one language on another language). 

Dec: Wrapping up, writing up a report.  

Topics:
- Understanding transfer in NER
     - Cross-lingual transfer (zero-shot, few shot, how much training data do we need in cross-lingual transfer etc). 

- Improving robustness of NER models in cross-lingual setups.    
     - Approaches for making NER more generalizable.    
     - Fine-tuning methods for cross-lingual setups.   
     - Cross-lingual modular models etc https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.255/.
